These two python scripts simulate the Monty Hall Problem.

"montyhall.py" allows the user to play the game show and when prompted with the menu, typing "data" will show the wins/losses when choosing to switch/keep doors.
"montyhallsimulated.py" simulates 100 rounds of both keeping the door or switching it.
